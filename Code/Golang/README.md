# NOTES

* println: Prints values to the console or standard output, separated by spaces, and adds a newline character at the end.
* printf: Prints formatted text to the console or standard output based on a format string and corresponding arguments.
* fprintf: Writes formatted text to a specific output stream, such as a file, based on a format string and corresponding arguments.
* sprint: Returns a string containing the formatted text without printing, usually a variable saves the output
* sprintf: Same thing, but just for formatting

println and printf are used for immediate output to the console, while fprintf is used for writing formatted text to a specific output stream. sprint and sprintf are used for generating formatted text as a string without immediate output.
