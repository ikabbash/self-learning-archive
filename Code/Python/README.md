# Python Notes

- `if __name__ == '__main__':`: Ensures code within it runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.
    - Dunder variables (e.g., `__name__`, `__file__`): Special variables used by Python to provide metadata about the module or script, aiding in execution control and introspection.
